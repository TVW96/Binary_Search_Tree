A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a type of binary tree in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left and right child. The key characteristic of a BST is that for any given node:

- All values in the left subtree are smaller than the node's value.
- All values in the right subtree are greater than the node's value.

This property allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of nodes.

### Usefulness:
- **Efficient Search Operations**: The BST allows for O(log n) average time complexity for search operations (if the tree is balanced), making it much faster than linear search in an unsorted list.
- **Sorted Data**: In-order traversal of a BST produces values in sorted order, which is useful for tasks like sorting or finding the smallest/largest elements.
- **Dynamic Data Handling**: Unlike arrays, which require fixed sizes, a BST can dynamically grow or shrink as elements are inserted or deleted.
- **Applications**: BSTs are commonly used in databases, file systems, and scenarios where efficient searching, sorting, and dynamic data manipulation are required.

In summary, a BST is useful for tasks that involve frequent search, insert, and delete operations on ordered data. However, its performance can degrade if the tree becomes unbalanced, which is why self-balancing variants like AVL trees or Red-Black trees are often used in practice.
